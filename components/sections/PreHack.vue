      <p class="subtitle">Tue Jan 16th, 17:30-20:00 (venue TBA)</p>
      <p>Two weeks before the hack we will host a "pre-hack" forum, where participants get the opportunity to join a cross functional team of field experts to get ideas or feedback on existing ones. Since the problems at hand are so insanely complex and multifaceted the solutions will require input from many points of view, or from many different proffesions.</p>
      <p>Some of the attending experts are researchers Ninni Carlsson and Mari Brännvall from Göteborgs Universitet, journalist and writer Elin Klemetz and Anna Thomasson, former project manager for “Fatta Man”.</p>
