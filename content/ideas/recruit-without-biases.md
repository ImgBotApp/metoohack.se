When we browse LinkedIn, and receive applicants on our Workable page, there is always biases. Against names, how people look, and their gender. What if we could remove those? My hypothesis is that we would hire a more diverse group of people in the end. An easy way to do this is to remove all profile pictures and names on LinkedIn and Workable with a Google Chrome plugin. And that plugin is what I intend to build.
