PhD and senior lecturer, works as a teacher and researcher. I have for many years been active on issues of gender, gender based violence and sexual abuse. In my PhD thesis, Avslöjandets tid / A time of telling (2009), I examine the phenomenon of working through child sexual abuse, and how it became historically possible in Sweden through the activism of the 2nd women’s movement, and the first public debates about sexual violence. My professional training within the field of Social Work is Social Pedagogy and Social Care, and my experience of Social Work practice has mainly been aiming at supporting and empowering women and children in exposed social positions. I can help you with research in the field of gender based violence in general, and child sexual abuse in particular.
