Powerlog is an app that attempts to shift the power balance in the office, and more specifically: in the meeting room. It works by measuring and analysing conversational dynamics, and gives you concrete data on how much of the total speaking time you take up and how many times you interrupt someone â€“ providing you with the opportunity to make a completely data-based ransacking of yourself.
