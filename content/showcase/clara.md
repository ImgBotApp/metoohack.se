Bad behavior and bad patterns start early. We believe that we as adults have an important task in speaking to our children about what words and acts can do to the people we interact with. Schools today differ a lot when it comes to how prepared they are to deal with these topics. Many times, bad behavior goes unseen and many schools have a very different view of reality compared to what students encounter every day. We want to give schools a real picture of what is going on and provide them with the tools and resources to engage in real conversations with children to create a more positive, inclusive climate.
