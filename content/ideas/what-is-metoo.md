An well-researched and unbiased discourse platform hosted by psychologists, social workers, lawyers, historians and politicians (of both genders obviously) to find out how to define the nature of harassment beyond subjectivity and provide safety without limiting individual freedom (and the uncertainty and play that is and was romance through the ages #minnesang). An interim between the #metoo hollywood movement and the Deneuve statement, if you will.
